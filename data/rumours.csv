rumour
"I've heard that deep below there is a great cube, and if you spin it a Djinn will be summoned to grant your every wish."
"I've spoken to some adventurers and they say the Goblins and Orcs are always fighting each other, some sort of feud he reckons."
"I've heard stories of an underground jungle, filled with dangerous man-eating plants."
"I've been down there and seen underground rivers, I reckon one or two of them might lead to the surface, but who knows how long you'd have to hold your breath"
"There's whispers, right, of a snake cult that does all sorts of evil and vile rituals and things down there."
"Lost my good friend Johnny on an expedition, the next time I go back, I see Johnny again except he's risen from the dead and trying to eat me, not going back again after that"
"Some of the rooms feel like they move, and sure enough when they do you end up somewhere else"
"A friend of a friend told me they saw a skeleton far down below, except it wasn't no ordinary skeleton, it was on fire!"
"There's an old man down there, some sort of god worshipper, I've heard he's helped adventurers who've found him"
"I've seen old schematics of the dungeon, from way back, says there's an old gold mine that should connect right up."
"There's a market down there, run by the Kobolds, a helpful lot actually."
"We found this large set of doors and thought surely the motherload would just be beyond them, but we got pushed back each time we tried to approach."
"Have you seen those tiny men? Never heard them speak, I reckon they're the ones really running things down there."
"There must be countless dead, I reckon they must pile them all up in a big cavern or something, like a graveyard, where else would they put them?"
"Be careful ringing any bells you find, you listen to me alright?"
"The last expedition I ever did we found this hole, dark as anything, we tossed something in - it never hit the bottom."
"We got lost this one time, down there so long we actually need to sleep. Woke up the next day, if you could call it that, and Johnny was raving mad, something messes with your head down there."
"Old Johnny used to tell me about this Albino Ape he saw down there once, smarter than most men, smarter than Johnny at least, but supposedly he was some sort of wizard?"
"Do you ever think about where all the monsters come from? The place has been plundered for years now and there's still monsters left? Doesn't make sense."
"Be careful of the pools down there, some of them are protected by guardians - I've seen people not be attacked though, maybe there's some sort of password?"
"I've heard a Wizard has set up a school in the dungeon, supposedly it's only on the first level, but I've never heard anyone say they found it."
"This one time we accompanied a warrior down, holier than thou type, the bastard. He made us stay the night in that intact structure, cold it was, all so that he could pray or something."
"If I don't see Coal when I arrive, I just pack my things back up and turn around, it's good luck if he's around. Whose Coal? That massive Black bear!"
"Make sure you've got plenty of provisions for the trip, and something extra for Coal. Fish is his favourite."
"I've heard there are sometimes messages written on the walls of the dungeon, but you can't see them unless it's pitch black."
